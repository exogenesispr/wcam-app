# WCAM-app
 
## Intro

Create a prototype of WoW Armory using Blizzard API to track WoW Classic characters and display its gear and character image to user (still need to see API limitations).
At first focus on creating a non-automatized way to get the data from Blizzard API, so I can focus on frontend app using React Native. After creating an mvp, use external libraries that automatize token, data fetch interval and use an own MongoDB to store external API data to pipeline API requests.

## Functional Description

### Use Cases

- Check own user characters from that account:
    - Will start focusing on characters max level.

### Modules
- API (external api requests + db + server logic)
- App (client interface + client logic) - React Native
- com (common utils and tools)

### Data Models
- WIP!
